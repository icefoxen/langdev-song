Note that the semantic checking of .sgi files is not as strong as it could be.
Generally, one should NEVER hand-edit these files, since typos and illegal
statements could cause Interesting things to happen.  The compiler should
create them right, and you should leave them alone.

Things I need to improve are:
Conditional compilation

Things I need to implement are:
Unions/variant types
Parametric polymorphism
Object-oriented programming (a la Obj-C)
